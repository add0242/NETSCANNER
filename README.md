
# NETSCANNER

This project was created as part of my final year undergraduate development project for my Bachelor of Science degree. 

This program will conduct a comprehensive scan of the local network and surrounding wireless networks using basic OS utilities, Nmap and airodump-ng.

```

### Manually
You can also run the module itself by downloading a ZIP file of this repository and running

```bash
  python3 NetScanner
```
